[Project 1: Predicting credit card fraud ](https://github.com/germeengehad/Predicting-credit-card-fraud)
- This project aims to predict credit card fraud using transaction data from European cardholders in 2023. It employs unsupervised models, including k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture models. Additionally, the project involves creating an API for the model and containerizing the application with Docker.
- In This Project I plan to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by feature engineering and selection, and then create pipelines for model training and prediction. Specifically, I have developed pipelines for both the KMeans and GaussianMixture models to predict labels for each data point. For each model
