## Data Science Projects
- In this portfolio, I will showcase various types of machine learning and deep learning models, including:
   -  Clustering Algorithms
   -  Classification models
   -  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
   -  Natural Language Processing (NLP) models

### Clustering Algorithms 

[Predicting Credit Card Fraud : Project Overviwe](https://github.com/germeengehad/Predicting-credit-card-fraud)
- This project aims to predict credit card fraud using transaction data from European cardholders in 2023. It employs unsupervised models, including k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture models. Additionally, the project involves creating an API for the model and containerizing the application with Docker.
- In This Project I plan to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by feature engineering and selection, and then create pipelines for model training and prediction. Specifically, I have developed pipelines for both the KMeans and GaussianMixture models to predict labels for each data point. For each model

### Classification Models

[Project 1 : Classification Telco Customers : Project Overview](https://github.com/germeengehad/Classification-Telco-Customers)
- This project aims to classify customers into churn or non-churn categories. Churn refers to customers who have discontinued their services within the last month. The goal is to assist companies in understanding the reasons behind customer churn and predicting which customers are likely to leave the company based on available data.
- In This Project I plan to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by data preprocessing, feature selection, and feature engineering. Subsequently, I intend to apply various machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost. Finally, I will evaluate the performance of these models and select the best-performing one for my dataset.

[Project 2 :Classification Traffic Situation : Project OverView](https://github.com/germeengehad/Classify-Traffic_Situation)
- This project aims to classify traffic conditions as low, normal, high, or heavy using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting and XGBoost.

- In This Project I plan to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by data preprocessing and then building the models.

[Project 3 : Heart Disease prediction : Project Overview](https://github.com/germeengehad/Heart-Disease-Prediction)

- In this project, we will predict whether a patient has heart disease or not using logistic regression based on a dataset of patient information.
- In This Project I plan to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by data preprocessing. After that, I will apply a logistic regression model to the data.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Models 
[Project 1 : Predict Human Character from a Facial Image : Project Overview](https://github.com/germeengehad/Predict-Human-Character-from-a-Facial-Image)

- This project aims to predict whether a person's character is savory or unsavory based on their images using deep learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- All data in this dataset was gathered from PUBLICLY accessible web sites or databases .This dataset consists of 2 classes, savory and unsavory. The unsavory class is populate with  facial Images of convicted felons. The savory class is populated with facial images of "ordinary" people. Granted some "ordinary" people may be convicted felon but I expect the percentage is very low.
- Initially, I planned to import the dataset from Kaggle. I then applied data augmentation and preprocessing techniques. After building and training a CNN model, I tested it by predicting the character (savory or unsavory) of two individuals using images. Note that only the training and validation datasets were used for model development. The model was tested with images sourced from the web, which I uploaded to this repository.

[Project 2 : Arabic Letters OCR Uing A CNN Model : Projct Overview](https://github.com/germeengehad/Identify-Arabic-letters-through-their-pictures?tab=readme-ov-file)

- This project aims to apply OCR to recognize Arabic letters using a CNN model trained on a collection of Arabic letter images. Additionally.
- In this project, I decided to start with data augmentation. I then created a new dataset by extracting only the Arabic letters, ignoring the numbers. This resulted in 28 classes, one for each Arabic letter. I separated the data into training and validation sets. Finally, I built a CNN model, trained it, and saved it in HDF5 format for download

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) models

[Twitter Sentiment Analysis And Classification : Project Overview](https://github.com/germeengehad/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Classification)

- This project aims to analyze and classify a dataset of tweets into Positive, Negative, and Neutral classes using various models, including RNN, LSTM, SVM, and Naive Bayes.
- In this project, I decided to upload the dataset from Kaggle. After that, I applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing. I used text embedding for the RNN and LSTM models, and TF-IDF vectorization for the SVM and Naive Bayes models. Finally, I built and trained the models
