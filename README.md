## Data Science Projects
- In this portfolio, I will showcase various types of machine learning and deep learning models, including:
 - Clustering Algorithms
 - Classification models
 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
 - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

### Clustering Algorithms 

[Predicting Credit Card Fraud : Project Overviwe](https://github.com/germeengehad/Predicting-credit-card-fraud)
- This project aims to predict credit card fraud using transaction data from European cardholders in 2023. It employs unsupervised models, including k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture models. Additionally, the project involves creating an API for the model and containerizing the application with Docker.
- In This Project I plan to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by feature engineering and selection, and then create pipelines for model training and prediction. Specifically, I have developed pipelines for both the KMeans and GaussianMixture models to predict labels for each data point. For each model

### Classification models

[Project 1 : Classification Telco Customers : Project Overview](https://github.com/germeengehad/Classification-Telco-Customers)
- This project aims to classify customers into churn or non-churn categories. Churn refers to customers who have discontinued their services within the last month. The goal is to assist companies in understanding the reasons behind customer churn and predicting which customers are likely to leave the company based on available data.
- In This Project I plan to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by data preprocessing, feature selection, and feature engineering. Subsequently, I intend to apply various machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost. Finally, I will evaluate the performance of these models and select the best-performing one for my dataset.

[Project 2 :Classification Traffic Situation : Project OverView](https://github.com/germeengehad/Classify-Traffic_Situation)
- This project aims to classify traffic conditions as low, normal, high, or heavy using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting and XGBoost.

- In This Project I plan to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by data preprocessing and then building the models.
